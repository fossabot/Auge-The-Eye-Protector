# Eye Protector
This little program helps in preventing eyestrain by reminding you to look at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds, after every 20 minutes (according to 20-20-20 rule), if your work involves looking at computer screen for long hours.

## Working
This program runs in the background and after every 20 minutes an overlay will be displayed in front of your currently running applications with a countdown timer and it will hide itself after 20 seconds.
